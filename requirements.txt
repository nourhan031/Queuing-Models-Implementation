INPUTS: (all characteristics of the queuing model)
1. Probabilty distribution of # arrivals (lambda)
2. prob dist of # service time (Mu)
3. # servers
4. system capacity
5. pop size
6. queuing discipline (FIFO? FCFS?)

OUPUTS:
1. type of queuing model related to the system
2. Mu_k and lambda_k
3. ALL performance measures: 
- Utilization rate of each server (% time each servr is busy)(Rho) 
- Avg WT cust spends in queue (W_q)
- Avg # cust in system (L)
- Avg # cust in queue (L_q)
- Avg WT a cust spends in system (W)
- Avg # cust in queue (L_q)
- Service Rate (1/Mu)
- Prob that all servers are busy (P_w)
4. P_0 (prob of having no cust in system) and P_k (prob of having k cust in system)
